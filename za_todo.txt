- Zip.Compress.LZMA, using LZMA.Encoding (available sinc rev. 457)
- Zip.Compress.Deflate: see specific "to do"'s in package's body
- Zip.LZ77: see specific "to do"'s in package's body

- tools: comp_zip: optionally, check only CRC
- tools: a Freshen_Zip tool that freshen files from an archive, or files
      to an archive, or both (i.e. like "zip -f" and/or "unzip -f" combined);
      possible with Zip.Create's Add_Compressed_Stream.
	  NB: AZip does the archive update part; so a command-line invocation
	  of AZip would fit this need.

- Make a public access to UnZip.Decompress, e.g. for a zlib proxy
      (see the Zada project), or the other way round: tranpose whole
      code for Deflate (compress & decompress) to Zada, then use it from
      Zip & UnZip
