- Taillaule: try with slider and/or initial lz window not centered

- Taillaule: compare slider to random and fixed in addition to initial

- Taillaule: use a corpus of files badly compressed by our Deflate comparatively
    to other Deflates (e.g. 7Z is outstanding with databases)

- LZ77 / IZ: similar to the test with TOO_FAR, try to cluster distances around
    values needing less extra bits (may not work at all...)

- LZ77: try yet another LZ77, e.g. from 7-Zip

- Add DeflOpt to slowest method, or approximate it by tweaking
    distance and length statistics before computing their Huffman codes, or
    reinvent it by computing the size of emitted codes and trying slight changes
    to the codes' bit lengths.

- comp_zip: optionally, check only CRC

- more profiling - see prof_za.cmd and test/prof.cmd

  OK:
    2**n expanded to 
    interfaces__unsigned_32($system__exp_uns__exp_unsigned(2, n) and 16#FFFF_FFFF#)
    ( System.Exp_Uns.Exp_Unsigned)
    instead of shift_left(1,n)
  25% gain un uza -t
  12% gain on za
