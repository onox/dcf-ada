- Taillaule: try with slider and/or initial lz window not centered

- Taillaule: compare slider to random and fixed in addition to initial

- Taillaule: use a corpus of comparatively badly compressed files

- LZ77 / IZ: similar to the test with TOO_FAR, try to cluster distances around
    values needing less extra bits (may not work at all...)

- LZ77: try yet another LZ77, e.g. from 7-Zip

- Add DeflOpt to slowest method, or approximate it by tweaking
    distance and length statistics before computing their Huffman codes

- UnZip.Decompress, Deflate: "strict" option with default True for dealing with
  incomplete distance code set (old PKZIP bug)

- comp_zip: optionally, check only CRC

- more profiling - see prof_za.cmd and test/prof.cmd

  OK:
    2**n expanded to 
    interfaces__unsigned_32($system__exp_uns__exp_unsigned(2, n) and 16#FFFF_FFFF#)
    ( System.Exp_Uns.Exp_Unsigned)
    instead of shift_left(1,n)
  25% gain un uza -t
  12% gain on za
