- LZ77: 3rd procedure that sends a list of possible DL codes (BT4),
     lets LZMA.Encoding choose the most predicted-probable one.
     Alternatively (to avoid complicating the LZ77 interface), hash
     the distance-length pairs, use the hash for a frequency index
     and give a preference to the most frequent pairs.

- LZMA.Encoding & Zip.Compress.LZMA_E: tune performance with well
     placed Inline pragmata
     
- Length_limited_Huffman_code_lengths and LZ77:
     at some point, turn the "paranoid" modes to False.

- Zip.Compress.Deflate, LZMA.Encoding and LZ77:
     see also specific "to do"'s in packages' bodies.

- tools: comp_zip: optionally, check only CRC
- tools: a Freshen_Zip tool that freshen files from an archive, or files
      to an archive, or both (i.e. like "zip -f" and/or "unzip -f" combined);
      possible with Zip.Create's Add_Compressed_Stream.
      NB: AZip does the archive update part; so a command-line invocation
      of AZip would fit this need.

- Make a public access to UnZip.Decompress, e.g. for a zlib proxy
      (see the Zada project), or the other way round: transpose whole
      code for Deflate (compress & decompress) to Zada, then use it from
      Zip & UnZip

- more profiling - see prof_za.cmd and test/prof.cmd

- tools: zipada: outputs sometimes progress like this:

  * Would be normal when defaulting to store, but Deflate seems to be chosen in the end.
  * Seems to occurr with data difficult to compress.
  * Compressed archive is OK, only the display is strange.

  - tools: find_zip: use an outward stream instead of decompressing completely each entry before searching (inward stream).
      This would use almost no memory, instead of the amount of the entry's uncompressed size.
      Same topic in AZip.
