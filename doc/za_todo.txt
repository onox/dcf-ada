- LZ77: 3rd procedure that sends a list of possible DL codes (BT4),
     lets LZMA.Encoding choose the most predicted-probable one.
     Alternatively (to ovoid complicating the LZ77 interface), hash
     the distance-length pairs, use the hash for a frequency index
     and give a preference to the most frequent pairs.

- LZMA.Encoding & Zip.Compress.LZMA_E: tune performance with well
     placed Inline pragmata
     
- Length_limited_Huffman_code_lengths and LZ77:
     at some point, turn the "paranoid" modes to False.

- Zip.Compress.Deflate, LZMA.Encoding and LZ77:
     see also specific "to do"'s in packages' bodies.

- tools: comp_zip: optionally, check only CRC
- tools: a Freshen_Zip tool that freshen files from an archive, or files
      to an archive, or both (i.e. like "zip -f" and/or "unzip -f" combined);
      possible with Zip.Create's Add_Compressed_Stream.
      NB: AZip does the archive update part; so a command-line invocation
      of AZip would fit this need.

- Make a public access to UnZip.Decompress, e.g. for a zlib proxy
      (see the Zada project), or the other way round: transpose whole
      code for Deflate (compress & decompress) to Zada, then use it from
      Zip & UnZip
