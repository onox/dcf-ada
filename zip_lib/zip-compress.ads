---------------
--
--  Created 9-Dec-2007
--
--  This package facilitates the storage or compression of data.
-- 
--  Note that unlike decompression where the decoding is unique,
--  there is a quasi indefinite number of ways of compressing data into
--  most Zip-supported formats, including LZW (Shrink), Reduce, or Deflate.
--  As a result, you may want to use your own way for compressing data.
--  This package is a portable one and doesn't claim to be the "best".
--  The term "best" is relative to the needs, since there are at least
--  two criteria that usually go in opposite directions: speed and
--  compression ratio, a bit like risk and return in finance.
