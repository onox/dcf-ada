--  There are three LZ77 encoders at choice here:
--
--    1/  LZ77_using_LZHuf, based on LZHuf
--
--    2/  LZ77_using_IZ, based on Info-Zip's Zip's deflate.c which is
--          actually the LZ77 part of Zip's compression.
--
--    3/  LZ77_using_BT4, based on LZMA SDK's BT4 algorithm.
--
--  Variant 1/, LZ77_using_LZHuf, is working since 2009. Two problems: it is slow
--     and not well adapted to the Deflate format (mediocre compression).
--
--  Variant 2/, LZ77_using_IZ, is much faster, and better suited for Deflate.
--     It has been added on 05-Mar-2016.
--     The code is tailored and optimized for a single set of
--     the String_buffer_size, Look_Ahead, Threshold LZ77 parameters - those for Deflate.
--
--  Variant 3/, LZ77_using_BT4, was added on 06-Sep-2016.
--     The seems to be the best match finder for LZMA on data of the >= 1 MB scale.

--  To do:
--
--  2/
--    - LZ77 / IZ: similar to the test with TOO_FAR, try to cluster distances around
--        values needing less extra bits (may not work at all...)
--    - LZ77 / IZ: tune TOO_FAR (max: 32767), see http://optipng.sf.net/pngtech/too_far.html
--        "TOO_FAR in zlib Is Not Too Far" for discussion

      --  Info-Zip algorithm  --
      --------------------------

      --  LZ77_using_IZ: based on deflate.c by Jean-Loup Gailly.
      --  Core description of the algorithm:
      --
      --     The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
      --     most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
      --     The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
      --     dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
      --     completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
      --     string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
      --     is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
      --     insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
      --     strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp [1]. A brute force approach
      --     is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
      --
      --     The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams.
      --
      --     [1] A description of the Rabin and Karp algorithm is given in the book
      --         "Algorithms" by R. Sedgewick, Addison-Wesley, p252.
