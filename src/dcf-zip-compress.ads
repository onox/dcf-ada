--  Zip.Compress
--  ------------
--
--  This package facilitates the storage or compression of data.
--
--  Note that unlike decompression where the decoding is unique,
--  there is a quasi indefinite number of ways of compressing data into
--  most Zip-supported formats, including LZW (Shrink), Reduce, Deflate, or LZMA.
--  As a result, you may want to use your own way for compressing data.
--  This package is a portable one and doesn't claim to be the "best".
--  The term "best" is relative to the needs, since there are at least
--  two criteria that usually go in opposite directions: speed and
--  compression ratio, a bit like risk and return in finance.

   --  data, not only the final compression format called "method" in
   --  Zip specifications.

      Deflate_Fixed, Deflate_1, Deflate_2, Deflate_3);

   type Method_To_Format_Type is array (Compression_Method) of Pkzip_Method;
   Method_To_Format : constant Method_To_Format_Type;

   --  Deflate_Fixed compresses the data into a single block and with predefined
   --  ("fixed") compression structures. The data are basically LZ-compressed
   --  only, since the Huffman code sets are flat and not tailored for the data.
   subtype Deflation_Method is Compression_Method range Deflate_Fixed .. Deflate_3;

   --  The multi-block Deflate methods use refined techniques to decide when to
   --  start a new block and what sort of block to put next.
